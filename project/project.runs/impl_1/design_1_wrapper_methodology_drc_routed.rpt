2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_1_i/tdc_0/inst/trig_arbiter_inst/fifo_rst_INST_0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) design_1_i/dips_0/inst/dips_v1_0_S01_AXI_inst/FDCE_inst/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/util_ds_buf_1/U0/IBUF_OUT[0] is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_i/util_ds_buf_1/U0/IBUF_OUT[0]. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware.

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#3 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks design_1_i/util_ds_buf_1/U0/IBUF_OUT[0] and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware.

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT design_1_i/main_0/inst/BUFG_clk40_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
