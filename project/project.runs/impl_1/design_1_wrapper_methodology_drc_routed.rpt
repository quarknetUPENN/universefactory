TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/util_ds_buf_0/U0/IBUF_OUT[0] is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_i/util_ds_buf_0/U0/IBUF_OUT[0]. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-2#2 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT design_1_i/main_0/inst/BUFG_clk40_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
